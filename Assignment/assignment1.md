Ans:The client–server architecture explains how the web works by dividing tasks between two sides:

Client: The user’s device (computer, phone) with a web browser

Server: A powerful computer that stores websites and data

How it works:

The client (browser) sends a request (e.g., open a webpage).

The server receives the request.

The server processes it and sends back the webpage.

The client displays the webpage to the user.

6.Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.

Email: Lets people send and receive messages over the Internet. You can also attach files like pictures or documents, and the receiver doesn’t have to be online at the same time.

FTP: Used to move files between computers on the Internet. It’s often used to upload or download large files, especially for websites.

VoIP: Lets people make voice calls using the Internet instead of traditional phone networks. It can also include video calls and voice messages.





7."The Internet is a network of networks." Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works. 

Ans: The Internet is called a “network of networks” because it is made up of many smaller networks (like home, school, and company networks) that are all connected together.

Packet switching works like this:

When you send something on the Internet, it is split into small pieces called packets.

Each packet travels across the Internet through different networks and routers.

Packets may take different paths to reach the destination.

When they arrive, the packets are put back together to form the original message.

This method makes the Internet fast, efficient, and reliable, even if some routes are busy or not working.
